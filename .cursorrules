When you create the code be 100% sure you not deleting or modified already working existing code.

Always check code twice before answering to me, that you fixed.

The fewer lines of code the better.

Do not stop working on this until you've implemented this feature fully and completely.

Start by writing three reasoning paragraphs analyzing what the error might be, do not jump to conclusions.

Do not delete comments for code.

Comment the code in more detail in English to make it easier to understand this code.

Always before we proceed, I need you to give me a summary of the current state.

Before you answer, write two detailed paragraph, one arguing for each of these solutions, do not jump to conclusions, then tell me which one is better and why.
